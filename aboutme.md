I am a student of a master's degree in introduction to research in artificial intelligence and at the same time I work as Big Data R&D at Gradiant. Previously I've been an organizer of the GDG of Santiago de Compostela and now I try to participate and get involved with the technological communities of Vigo http://vigotech.org/

I think that i don't need to say that I love trying and investigating most of the new technologies that fall into my hands regardless of their purpose. On the other hand, I also try to learn tools and techniques that help me be more productive and improve my software's quality

Out of this web page you can found me on my social networks or you can try to meet me on a technology event :)
